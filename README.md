# A Stitch in Time

## a knitting-themed word guessing game

### So what is this, anyway?

This is a small game where users guess various knitting-related words. Try to complete the row you're on without dropping a single stitch!

Type guesses as to the word displayed directly into the browser window. The game will update accordingly. As you make guesses, stitches will "drop" from the left needle -- when you're out of stitches, you're out of guesses, and the game will end.

The game will track wins, losses, and the number of times you've played.
